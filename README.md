# CSS Navbar Flexbox challenge: frontend project 

This was a CodeNation project to practise using CSS flexbox.

## Project Brief

For the project we were given an index.html page containing a NavBar of six items.  There was also a CSS file with some styling not related to flexbox - to set colours for the body and navbar for example.  The CSS file also contained media queries with screen sizes.  

The project brief was to use CSS flexbox to make the navbar look as close to the examples in the given pdf file as possible.

We also needed to change the CSS for each of the given screen sizes, to make it look like the examples in the pdf file.
